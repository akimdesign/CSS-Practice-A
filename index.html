        <h2>The 100</h2>
        <p>Ninety-seven years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out almost all life on Earth,
            thousands
            of people now live in a space station orbiting Earth, which they call the Ark. Three generations
            have
            been born in space, bringing the population of the Ark beyond carrying capacity. One-hundred
            juvenile
            detainees are sent to Earth in a last attempt to determine whether it is habitable. They discover
            that
            some survived the apocalypse: the grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the
            Reapers,
            another group of grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the Mountain Men; and the Mountain
            Men, who live in Mount Weather, descended from those who locked themselves away before the
            apocalypse.
            Under the leadership of Bellamy and Clarke, the juveniles attempt to survive the harsh surface
            conditions, battle hostile grounders and establish communication with the Ark.</p>

        <h2>Kingdom</h2>
        <p>Set in Koreaâ€™s medieval Joseon period, it tells the story of Crown Prince Lee Chang (Ju Ji-hoon), who
            becomes embroiled in a coup/political conspiracy and is forced to embark upon a mission to
            investigate the spread of a mysterious undead plague that has beset the current emperor and the country's
            southern provinces.
            <br>
            The story starts with a notice written in Korean on a billboard, claiming the king of
            Joseon is dead and the crown prince should be crowned immediately as the new king. However, inside the
            palace, the king is known to be severely sick and has been secretly treated for the past 10 days. No one was
            allowed to visit the king, not even the crown prince himself. Late at night, the crown prince sneaks
            out to visit his father, wanting to know the truth. But instead of his own father, he encountered the
            silhouette of a beastly monster. Accompanied by the physician Seo-bi (Bae Doo-na), the enigmatic
            Yeong-sin (Kim Sung-kyu), and his personal guard Mu-yeong (Kim Sang-ho), Prince Lee Chang must
            prevent the advance of the plague towards his home capital of Hanyang (present-day Seoul) while addressing
            the sinister coup masterminded by Minister Cho Hak-ju (Ryu Seung-ryong) and his family aimed towards his
            deposition from the throne.</p>
